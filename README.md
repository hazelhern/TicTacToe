Overview
This project is a web-based Tic Tac Toe AI game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game supports the following three modes:
1.	Human vs. Human – two-player mode that alternates with each player’s turn. 
2.	Human vs. AI – Player can play against the AI and select whether the AI plays as X or O.
3.	AI vs. AI – Both AIs compete against each other with the click of a button.
The AI algorithms are implemented using minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning.  

Features
•	Web-based – runs in the browser with no installation required.
•	AI algorithms – using minimax and alpha-beta pruning
•	Real-time performance display – shows decision time, nodes explored, pruned nodes, and pruning efficiency percentage while the AI thinks.
•	Winning line animation – animated line appears across the winning cells 
•	Result screen – displays overlay with “X WINS”, “O WINS”, “DRAW” with a restart button.
•	Reset – switching modes or clicking “Restart” resets all game state. 

How to Run
1.	Open the index.html file in any modern browser.
2.	Select a mode and algorithm from the dropdowns
3.	For AI modes, click ‘Start Game’
4.	Play the game or watch the performances update as the AI makes decisions.
